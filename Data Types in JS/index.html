    <h1>Data Types in JS</h1>
    <p>
      Number: Represents numeric data, both integer and floating-point numbers.
      Examples include 5, 3.14, and -10.
    </p>
    <p>
      String: Represents textual data enclosed within single (') or double (")
      quotes. Examples include "Hello", 'JavaScript', and "123".
    </p>
    <p>
      Boolean: Represents a logical value indicating true or false. It's often
      used in conditional statements and comparisons. Examples include true and
      false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a
      value. If a variable is declared without being assigned a value, its
      default value is undefined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's often
      used to signify a variable or object property that has no value or is
      explicitly cleared.
    </p>
    <p>
      BigInt: Represents whole numbers larger than Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER,
      which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the
      Number primitive. BigInts can be created by appending n to the end of an
      integer literal or by calling the BigInt() function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Symbol: Represents a unique and immutable value, often used as property
      keys in objects to avoid name clashes.
