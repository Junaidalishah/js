// Variable Rules
// Variable names are case sensitive;
// “a” & “A” is different

// let a = 10;
// let A = 11;
// console.log(a);
// console.log(A);

// Only letters, digits, underscore( _ ) and $ is allowed. (not even space)

// let 12Abc = 10 is wrong
// The first character of a variable name must be a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($).

// Reserved Words: Certain words in JavaScript have special meanings and are reserved for specific purposes (like if, else, for, function, etc.). These reserved words cannot be used as variable names.

// The first character of a variable name must be a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($). It cannot be a digit or any other special character.

// var x = 10;
// var x = 20;
// console.log(x);
