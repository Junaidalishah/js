    <h1>Synchronous</h1>
    <h2>
      Synchronous means the code runs in a particular sequence of instructions
      given in the program. Each instruction waits for the previous instruction
      to complete its execution.
    </h2>
    <h1>Asynchronous</h1>
    <h2>
      Due to synchronous programming, sometimes imp instructions get blocked due
      to some previous instructions, which causes a delay in the UI.
      Asynchronous code execution allows to execute next instructions
      immediately and doesn't block the flow
